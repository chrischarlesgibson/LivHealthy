## Description

    This is the Liv-Healthy interactive web site build as a collaboration between four web developers to act as a guide to develop a better nutrition and fitness regimen. This is accomplished by providing inspirational quotes with search capabilities for recipes and fitness routines with a current emphasis on the former search functions.

    When a user saves a recipe it is populated to a chart. Each subsequent recipe information is added to a chart until the user decides to reset the information.
